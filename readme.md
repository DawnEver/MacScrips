# Mac scripts

I have been tired with repeated clicking on mac for long.As a geek,it's time to do something.

I walked to shell first,and have many problems solved and many unsolved.Then I explored mac scripts and Automator.

As a collection of automatic scripts,many problems in this repo may have a similar solution on the Internet  and in fact I search the Internet  too
