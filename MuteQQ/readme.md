# MuteQQ

I have been mad with login and terminal alert of QQ for Mac for long,especially when your network is not good.I tried to edit its preferences but find no item about it.

So I googled for solutions,and find its sound resource in QQ resource directory.(*/Applications/QQ.app/Contents/Resources*)So this script come into being.

What's not as good as expected is that I have to execute this script again as QQ upgrating.
[To Do] tried to automatically execute the script when QQ upgratedã€‚
