# MacState

Many days after I reinstalled macOS Big Sur on my mbp,an unknown error caught me when I tried to find my CPU temperature.
I used iStats to listen mac before,but somehow I cannot install it again today.
It's stupid to install a complex app just to get several pieces of CPU information.
Another choice is powermetrics,but it keeps freshing and is too dizzy.
so I decide to code a shell script based on powermetrics.
- you can run *editEnv* to add *macrar* to environment path */usr/local/bin*,then you can run the script in the terminal
