## Log

Its normal and efficient to control versions with *git* or *svn* when developing in team.But it may be your wishful thinking to work with teammates not good at these useful tools(even not good at computer).
It's merciful to see all progress come down to zero after a version sync.In this team,using git would be a disaster.

In a project,my failure in git server (problems like server version delay and uncomplete version sync annoy me a lot)pushes me to develop my own tool.Git was developed by linus himself,so why couldn't me?

When I reading about multi-threads,it hit me that 'lock' can help me.Efficency vs safety,I choose the latter.

[to-do] check files each time to avoid unexcepted changes(make shotcuts like git)
